# KTBoost

This package implements several boosting algorithm. In particular, this includes tree and kernel boosting as well as the combined KTBoost algorithm. The package supports both gradient and Newton boosting updates as well as a hybrid version of the two for trees as base learners. Further, the package implements several loss functions which inlucdes the Tobit likelihood (i.e. the Grabit model).

The package re-uses code from scikit-learn and its workflow is very similar to that of scikit learn.
